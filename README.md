ABSTRACT


In this modern era, day to day life became smarter and interlinked with technology. We already know some voice assistance like google, Siri. etc. Now in our voice assistance system, it can act as a basic command performer. This project works on voice input and give output through voice and displays the text on the screen. The main agenda of our voice assistance makes people smart and give instant and computed results. The voice assistance takes the voice input through our microphone (Bluetooth and wired microphone) and it converts our voice into computer understandable language gives the required solutions and answers which are asked by the user. This assistance connects with the web to provide results that the user has questioned. Natural Language Processing algorithm helps computer machines to engage in communication using natural human language in many forms.
 Today the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can organize a natural human-machine interaction (through voice, communication, gestures, facial expressions, etc.) are gaining in popularity. One of the most studied and popular was the direction of interaction, based on the understanding of the machine by the machine of the natural human language. It is no longer a human who learns to communicate with a machine, but a machine learns to communicate with a human, exploring his actions, habits, behaviour and trying to become his personalized assistant.
Virtual assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks, such as showing weather reports, creating remainders, making shopping lists etc. They can take commands via text (online chatbots) or by voice. Voice-based intelligent assistants need an invoking word or wake word to activate the listener, followed by the command. We have so many virtual assistants, such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana.
This system is designed to be used efficiently on desktops. Personal assistants software improves user productivity by managing routine tasks of the user and by providing information from an online source to the user.


PROBLEM DEFINITION

Usually, user needs to manually manage multiple sets of applications to  
complete one task. For example, a user trying to make a travel plan needs to check for  
airport codes for nearby airports and then check travel sites for tickets between  
combinations of airports to reach the destination. There is need of a system that can  
manage tasks effortlessly. we already have multiple virtual assistants. But we hardly use it.  
There are number of people who have issues in voice recognition. These systems can  
understand English phrases but they fail to recognize in our accent. 
                                                        Our way of pronunciation is way distinct from theirs also  
they are easy to use on mobile devices than desktop systems. There is need of a virtual  
assistant that can understand English in Indian accent and work on desktop system. when a  
virtual assistant is not able to answer questions accurately, it’s because it lacks the proper   
context or doesn’t understand the intent of the question. Its ability to answer questions  
relevantly only happens with rigorous optimization, involving both humans and machine  
learning. Continuously ensuring solid quality control strategies will also help manage the risk  
of the virtual assistant learning undesired bad behaviours. They require large amount of

These systems can understand English phrases but they fail to recognize in our accent. Our way of pronunciation is way distinct from theirs .Also, they are easy to use on mobile devices than desktop systems. There is need of a virtual assistant that can understand English in Indian accent and work on desktop system .When a virtual assistant is not able to answer questions accurately, it’s because it lacks the proper context or doesn’t understand the intent of the question. Its ability to answer questions relevantly only happens with rigorous optimization, involving both humans and machine learning. Continuously ensuring solid quality control strategies will also help manage the risk of the virtual assistant learning undesired bad behaviors. They require large amount of information to be fed in order for it to work efficiently .Virtual assistant should be able to model complex task dependencies and use these models to recommend optimized plans for the user. It needs to be tested for finding optimum paths when a task has multiple sub-tasks and each sub-task can have its own sub-tasks. In such a case there can be multiple solutions to paths, it should be able to consider user preferences, other active tasks, priority in order to recommend a particular plan.
